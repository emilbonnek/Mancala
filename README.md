# Mancala
This was my exam project for the course Advanced object oriented programming using C# and .NET(62413) at Technical University of Denmark.

It is a C# application that plays the game of Mancala for 2 players. It can be played with Artificial Intelligient agents or a player using the cursor. The AI plays using a min-max algorithm and can be adjusted to different levels of depth via the gui.
